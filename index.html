        <!--what exites you about coding? How do you think it can change the world?-->
        <p class="d1a1">What exites me about coding is the oppurtunity to apply my mindset and problem solving skills into a more lucrative setting. Coding is the first thing i have found that doenst involve high physical risk and sensory stimulation, that I have been able to enjoy and find instrinsic motivation. 
            it has already changed the world and will continue to do so. Everything is code. From your gas pump, to phones, to a microwave, there is no modern society without code. Just in studying, and learning code i have learned to think and breakdown problems in a more effecient way. The process of thinking i have been reinforcing has spilled over into other areas of my life. Every micro, repeats itself macro. If coding teaches the individual how to process and react to information in a way that doesnt require external resources to figure out. That same effect will play out on a larger scale.
            Individual impowerment leads to greater understanding of community. The consequences is relying less on leaders, and pushes us to rely on each other and ourselves. Very much in the way the internet has manifested. This is how we stay free, and how coding changes the world. If you dont trust yourself or know how to interpret information this leads to psychosis in the macro. how can you trust any body else, if you cant even trust yourself? once people lack understanding, they can be overwhelmed and fear can be induced. Confusion and fear lead to desperation, attatchment to a "savior". Religeon, hitler, trump. This is how entities and people gain power. Individual independance and trust in the self and the neighbors ability to think for themselves is what prevents power consolidation. This is the mindset coding can teach people.
